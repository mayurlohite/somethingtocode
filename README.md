# somethingtocode.com
A more than community to spread the knowledge in programming world.

# Vision
At first I started somethingtocode.com blog to help developers who are recently enters in programming world. There are many personal blog, article websites and Q/A websites are present on the internet but not one of them is open source. So I decided to make web application which combine all of these above feature in one application and important thing is, its open source.

We will start first with simple article posting and later we will go to Q/A as well as social network of programmers. So developers life will be close to each other.

I need the support of developers to make this vision  into reality. So contributions to community is welcome.

We will follow the Vincent Driessen branching model because I personally used this model and its really successful. For this I really appreciated Vincent Driessen to such good GIT workflow.
